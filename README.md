# bamazon

This project contains two different programs the user can run.  

The first is called bamazonCustomer.js.  The user is presented a table with all 
of the items available from the bamazon store.  The user can select an item to buy and enter a quantity.  If there are enough items to purchase, the tranaction will be completed and the program will show the cost of the items purchased.

The second program is called bamazonManager.js.  This program provides additional functionality in the bamazon marketplace.  The manager has a menu where they can view all items, pull a report of items that need to be restocked (five or fewer), add/remove quantities of an item, and add a new item to inventory.
